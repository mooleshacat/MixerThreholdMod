THIS BRANCH "copilot-log-input-only-from-testing" IS MEANT FOR INPUTTING MY LOGS FOR COPILOT TO SEE THEM.

THE WORK SHOULD BE DONE IN A DIFFERENT FEATURE/FIX BRANCH. YOU MAY MAKE THE PR ACTUAL, NOT DRAFT.

THIS BRANCH IS MEANT TO BE USED IN RELATION TO "development" BRANCH AND ANY BRANCHES BASED FROM IT.

WE DO NOT COMMIT DIRECTLY TO MASTER.

MOST IMPORTANT: THIS BRANCH IS FOR LOGS ONLY . THE LOGS ARE RELATED TO THE CODE WHICH YOU WILL COPY FROM
"development" INTO YOUR NEW BRANCH WHERE YOU TROUBLESHOOT THE LOGS FROM THIS BRANCH & CRASH.

These are the log files from the most recent run.

I have included in this one:

- Melonlogger debug logs (combined into my logs)
- My mod debug logs

You might see multiple runs, if there is a date/timestamp use the most recent one.

If there are instructions below to also look at a second or third log included, please view that log as well.

DO NOT CLOSE THIS BRANCH.
