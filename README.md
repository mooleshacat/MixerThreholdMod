# MixerThreholdMod-0_0_1

Working on mod ... Not adviseable to use currently. Release coming soon :)

Yes I am playing with Github Copilot :)

"your mod name has a typo" - no actually it does not. I've reverse engineered using dnSpy Schedule 1 and I know the name was spelled with a typo in the main code. So while it is a typo, it is not a typo on my part ;)
