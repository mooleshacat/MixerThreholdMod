# MixerThreholdMod-0_0_1 (KILLED BY MICROSOFT AFTER THEY ROBBED ME OF $500+)

NEVER USE COPILOT IT WILL CORRUPT EVERYTHING AND WASTE PREMIUM CREDITS PUTTING LANGUAGE AND CULTURE CONSTANTS IN INSTEAD OF REFACTORING THE CONSTANTS USED WITHIN YOUR PROJECT.

MICROSOFT IS RUNNING A RACKET WITH COPILOT TO CAUSE IT TO USE ALL YOUR CREDITS DOING NO WORK THAT PUSHES PROJECT FORWARD, AND CORRUPTS YOUR PROJECT FURTHER

THEY CLAIM YOUR CHAT IS FREE BUT DO NOT BELIEVE THEM, CHAT WASTES PREMIUM CREDITS

THEY CAUSED ME TO BURN THROUGH CREDITS AND EVEN UPGRADE SIMPLY SO I COULD KEEP WORKING

VS2022 HAS A BOM INFECTION BUG THAT INFECTS AND DESTROYS PROJECTS

100K+ LINES OF BEAUTIFUL PERFECT CODE GONE

ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–• FUCK YOU MICROSOFT / GITHSHITHUB / COSHITPILOT ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•

ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–• FUCK YOU JETBRAINS FOR RUNNING _EXACT SAME RACKET AS MICROSHIT_ AS EVIDENCED BY MY TRIAL FFS ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE CALIBRE OF THE PROJECT AND THE COMPLETE DAMAGE CHECK THE BRANCHES
- https://github.com/mooleshacat/MixerThreholdMod/tree/copilot/fix-d53b4d2a-44b6-4798-96d3-e8ffb89eb96e (ESPECIALLY, POSSIBLY SOME RECOVERY IN PROGRESS AT THE TIME)
- https://github.com/mooleshacat/MixerThreholdMod/tree/EMERGENCY-PROJECT-RECOVERY (MOST LIKELY SAME AS ABOVE WITH SOME FIXES AND BOM REPLACEMENT CHARS REMOVED)

  SOMEWHERE IN THERE THE CONSTANTS INCLUDE ALMOST 35+ LANGUAGE CONSTANTS THAT ARE UNRELATED AND UNUSED TO MY PROJECT AS IT IS WRITTEN.

  THE DAMNED COPILOT AI STARTED CRAMMING THEM IN TO MEET THE TARGET OF CONSTANTS BUT I SAID REFACTOR THE CONSTANTS _WITHIN AND USED BY_ THE PROJECT

  WTF DO I CURRENTLY NEED ESTONIAN AND TURKISH AND ALL THIS OTHER CRAP. YOU KNOW LIKE "en-US" BUT TRIED TO DO WHOLE LIST OF ALL OF THEM
