# MixerThreholdMod v1.0.0 üß™

A comprehensive mod for **Schedule 1** that enhances the mixer system with crash-resistant saves, increased capacity, and intelligent threshold control.

## Critical Features üöÄ

### üõ°Ô∏è **Save Crash Prevention** (Primary Focus)
- **Emergency save protection** - prevents data loss during crashes and extended gameplay
- **Atomic file operations** - ensures save integrity through temp file + rename strategy  
- **Save cooldown system** - prevents corruption from rapid-fire saves
- **Automatic backup management** - maintains 5 most recent backups with cleanup

### üîß **Enhanced Mixer System**
- **Increases mixer threshold from 10 to 20** - matching game's maximum stack size
- **Persistent threshold settings** - survives game overwrites and save/load cycles
- **Thread-safe operations** - prevents UI freezes and main thread blocking

## Installation üì•

1. Download latest release from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1) (when available)
2. Extract to your Schedule 1 Mods directory
3. Launch game - mod auto-initializes with comprehensive logging

## Save Backup System üóÉÔ∏è

**Automatic Protection**: Every save operation creates timestamped backups in:
```
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\TVGS\Schedule 1\Saves\nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\MixerThreholdMod_backup\
```

**Backup Structure**:
- Keeps 5 most recent backups per save slot (max 25 total)
- Format: `SaveGame_2_backup_2025-01-15_14-30-22`
- Automatic cleanup prevents disk space issues

**Restore Process**:
1. Navigate to backup folder above
2. Copy desired backup to main save directory
3. Rename to original save folder name (e.g., `SaveGame_2`)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Always backup current save first!**

## Technical Details ‚öôÔ∏è

### Thread Safety & .NET 4.8.1 Compatibility
- **No main thread blocking** - all file I/O uses async patterns or proper timeout protection
- **Thread-safe collections** - concurrent access handled safely across all operations  
- **Framework compatibility** - explicit .NET 4.8.1 syntax (no string interpolation, proper cancellation tokens)
- **Comprehensive error handling** - extensive try/catch blocks with verbose logging

### Performance & Reliability
- **Memory leak prevention** - proper resource disposal and cleanup
- **Atomic operations** - temp file strategy prevents partial writes
- **Emergency fallbacks** - multiple strategies for event attachment and save operations
- **Minimal game impact** - non-blocking coroutines maintain smooth gameplay

## Compatibility & Requirements üîß

- **Game**: Schedule 1 (latest version)
- **Framework**: MelonLoader + HarmonyLib
- **Target**: .NET Framework 4.8.1
- **Conflicts**: Compatible with most mods (extensive defensive programming)

## Issue Reporting & Support üêõ

**When reporting issues, please provide as much detail as possible to help with troubleshooting:**

### Required Information
1. **MelonLoader Console Log** - copy the entire console output from when the issue occurs
2. **Save Game Details** - mention if issue happens on new saves, loaded saves, or specific save slots
3. **Reproduction Steps** - exact steps that cause the issue
4. **Game State** - how long was game running, were you saving repeatedly, any other mods active
5. **System Info** - Windows version, game version, MelonLoader version
6. **Error Messages** - any error dialogs, crashes, or unusual behavior

### How to Get Logs
- **MelonLoader Console**: Shows in-game when pressing F4 or check `MelonLoader/Latest.log`
- **Mod Logs**: Look for entries starting with `[MixerThreholdMod]`
- **Crash Logs**: Usually in game directory or MelonLoader folder

### Best Practices for Reporting
- **Be Specific**: "Save crashes" is less helpful than "Save crashes after 30+ minutes gameplay on SaveGame_3"
- **Include Context**: Were you using other mods, doing specific actions, or experiencing performance issues?
- **Test Isolation**: If possible, try reproducing with only this mod active

**The more information you provide, the faster we can identify and fix the issue!**
