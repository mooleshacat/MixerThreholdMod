## Console Commands üéÆ

The mod provides 13 powerful console commands for testing, monitoring, debugging, and advanced save operations:

### Available Commands

#### **Mixer Management**

##### `mixer_reset`
Reset all mixer values and clear tracked data:
```
mixer_reset                     # Clears all saved mixer values and resets ID counter
```

##### `mixer_save` 
Force immediate save operation:
```
mixer_save                      # Triggers save with cooldown protection
```

##### `mixer_path`
Display current save path and mixer count:
```
mixer_path                      # Shows active save location and tracked mixer count
```

##### `mixer_emergency`
Trigger emergency save operation:
```
mixer_emergency                 # Immediate save without cooldown checks
```

#### **Advanced Save Testing**

##### `saveprefstress <count> [delay] [bypass]`
Stress test mixer preferences saves:

**Parameters:**

- `delay` - Delay between saves in seconds (optional, default: 0)
- `bypass` - Cooldown behavior (optional, default: true)
  - `true` (bypass) - Ignores game's 2-second save cooldown for rapid testing
  - `false` (respect cooldown) - Waits for game's natural save cooldown, safer for production

```
saveprefstress 10               # 10 saves, no delay, bypass=true (rapid testing)
saveprefstress 5 2.0            # 5 saves, 2s delay, bypass=true
saveprefstress 20 false         # 20 saves, no delay, respect cooldown (safer)

- **Usage validation** - Helpful error messages and examples for incorrect usage

### System Monitoring (DEBUG Mode Only) üñ•Ô∏è

**Hardware Performance Tracking**: Enhanced debugging capabilities that activate only in DEBUG builds:

**Features**:
- **CPU Usage Monitoring** - Real-time processor utilization during save operations
- **Memory Usage Tracking** - RAM consumption with garbage collection analysis
- **Disk I/O Performance** - Storage operation monitoring and bottleneck detection
- **Process Metrics** - Working set, private memory, and CPU time tracking
- **Performance Profiling** - Before/after system state comparisons for operations

**System Information Logging**:
- Operating system and .NET framework details
- Processor specifications (cores, clock speed)
- Memory configuration (total RAM, graphics memory)
- Storage device information and free space
- Unity engine hardware detection

**Integration Points**:
- All console commands include system performance snapshots
- Stress testing operations log system state at key intervals
- Save operations monitored for performance impact
- Comprehensive performance summaries with overhead analysis

**Compiler Directives**: 
- Automatically disabled in RELEASE builds for production deployment
- No performance impact when not in DEBUG mode
- Graceful degradation when WMI or performance counters unavailable

## Save Backup System üóÉÔ∏è

**Automatic Protection**: Every save operation creates timestamped backups in:
```
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\TVGS\Schedule 1\Saves\nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\MixerThreholdMod_backup\
```

**Backup Structure**:
- Keeps 5 most recent backups per save slot (max 25 total)
- Format: `SaveGame_2_backup_2025-01-15_14-30-22`
- Automatic cleanup prevents disk space issues

**Restore Process**:
1. Navigate to backup folder above
2. Copy desired backup to main save directory
3. Rename to original save folder name (e.g., `SaveGame_2`)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Always backup current save first!**

## Technical Details ‚öôÔ∏è

### Thread Safety & .NET 4.8.1 Compatibility
- **No main thread blocking** - all file I/O uses async patterns or proper timeout protection
- **Thread-safe collections** - concurrent access handled safely across all operations  
- **Framework compatibility** - explicit .NET 4.8.1 syntax (no string interpolation, proper cancellation tokens)
- **Comprehensive error handling** - extensive try/catch blocks with verbose logging

### Performance & Reliability
- **Memory leak prevention** - proper resource disposal and cleanup
- **Atomic operations** - temp file strategy prevents partial writes
- **Emergency fallbacks** - multiple strategies for event attachment and save operations
- **Minimal game impact** - non-blocking coroutines maintain smooth gameplay

## Compatibility & Requirements üîß

- **Game**: Schedule 1 (latest version)
- **Framework**: MelonLoader + HarmonyLib
- **Target**: .NET Framework 4.8.1
- **Conflicts**: Compatible with most mods (extensive defensive programming)

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical MelonLoader Window Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**DO NOT CLICK** in the MelonLoader console window to inspect logs while the game is running:

- **Clicking pauses MelonLoader** and can cause the game to crash after a brief delay
- **To resume**: Press `Space` or `Enter` key, but damage may already be done
- **Safe inspection**: Use `Alt + Tab` to switch between windows - do not click inside the MelonLoader window
- **Log review**: Review logs after closing the game to avoid interruption

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### Common Issues

#### Console Commands Not Working
- **MONO builds**: Ensure you're typing commands correctly (case-sensitive)
- **IL2CPP builds**: Wait for complete mod initialization (look for "initialization COMPLETE" message)
- Try the `help` command to verify mod is loaded
- Check MelonLoader logs for initialization errors

#### IL2CPP Build Issues
- **TypeLoadException messages**: Normal during initialization - mod handles these automatically
- **Slow initialization**: IL2CPP builds need 5-10 seconds for type resolution
- **Console commands delayed**: First few commands may take longer to process
- **Manual logging**: Use `msg` and `warn` commands to verify console integration is working

#### Save System Issues  
- Use `mixer_path` to verify save location
- Check available disk space in save directory
- Review logs for file permission errors

#### Performance Issues
- Use `profile` command to identify bottlenecks
- Monitor system resources with stress testing commands
- Consider reducing stress testing parameters

## Issue Reporting & Support üêõ

**When reporting issues, please provide as much detail as possible to help with troubleshooting:**

### Required Information
1. **MelonLoader Console Log** - copy the entire console output from when the issue occurs
2. **Save Game Details** - mention if issue happens on new saves, loaded saves, or specific save slots
3. **Reproduction Steps** - exact steps that cause the issue
4. **Game State** - how long was game running, were you saving repeatedly, any other mods active
5. **System Info** - Windows version, game version, MelonLoader version
6. **Error Messages** - any error dialogs, crashes, or unusual behavior

### How to Get Logs
- **MelonLoader Console**: Shows in-game when pressing F4 or check `MelonLoader/Latest.log`
- **Mod Logs**: Look for entries starting with `[MixerThreholdMod]`
- **Crash Logs**: Usually in game directory or MelonLoader folder

### Best Practices for Reporting
- **Be Specific**: "Save crashes" is less helpful than "Save crashes after 30+ minutes gameplay on SaveGame_3"
- **Include Context**: Were you using other mods, doing specific actions, or experiencing performance issues?
- **Test Isolation**: If possible, try reproducing with only this mod active

**The more information you provide, the faster we can identify and fix the issue!**
