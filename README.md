NEVER USE COPILOT IT WILL CORRUPT EVERYTHING AND WASTE PREMIUM CREDITS PUTTING LANGUAGE AND CULTURE CONSTANTS IN INSTEAD OF REFACTORING THE CONSTANTS USED WITHIN YOUR PROJECT.

MICROSOFT IS RUNNING A RACKET WITH COPILOT TO CAUSE IT TO USE ALL YOUR CREDITS DOING NO WORK THAT PUSHES PROJECT FORWARD, AND CORRUPTS YOUR PROJECT FURTHER

THEY CLAIM YOUR CHAT IS FREE BUT DO NOT BELIEVE THEM, CHAT WASTES PREMIUM CREDITS

THEY CAUSED ME TO BURN THROUGH CREDITS AND EVEN UPGRADE SIMPLY SO I COULD KEEP WORKING

VS2022 HAS A BOM INFECTION BUG THAT INFECTS AND DESTROYS PROJECTS

100K+ LINES OF BEAUTIFUL PERFECT CODE GONE
