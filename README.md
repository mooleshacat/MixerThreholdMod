# MixerThreholdMod v1.0.0 üß™ - MONO/IL2CPP Compatible

A comprehensive mod for **Schedule 1** that enhances the mixer system with crash-resistant saves, increased capacity, and intelligent threshold control. **Now fully compatible with both MONO and IL2CPP builds!**

## Build Environment Compatibility üîÑ

### MONO Build Support ‚úÖ
- **Fully Compatible**: All features work perfectly in MONO builds
- **Direct Type Loading**: Uses standard .NET reflection patterns
- **Standard Performance**: Normal execution speed and memory usage

### IL2CPP Build Support ‚úÖ
- **Fully Compatible**: All features work in IL2CPP builds using dynamic type resolution
- **Safe Type Loading**: Uses Assembly.GetType() to avoid TypeLoadException
- **Graceful Degradation**: Mod continues to function even if some game types are not available
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead from dynamic type resolution

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: IL2CPP builds require additional type loading time during mod initialization. This is normal and expected.

## Critical Features üöÄ

### üõ°Ô∏è **Save Crash Prevention** (Primary Focus)
- **Emergency save protection** - prevents data loss during crashes and extended gameplay
- **Atomic file operations** - ensures save integrity through temp file + rename strategy  
- **Save cooldown system** - prevents corruption from rapid-fire saves
- **Automatic backup management** - maintains 5 most recent backups with cleanup

### üîß **Enhanced Mixer System**
- **Increases mixer threshold from 10 to 20** - matching game's maximum stack size
- **Persistent threshold settings** - survives game overwrites and save/load cycles
- **Thread-safe operations** - prevents UI freezes and main thread blocking

## Installation üì•

1. Download latest release from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1) (when available)
2. Extract to your Schedule 1 Mods directory
3. Launch game - mod auto-initializes with comprehensive logging

## Save Backup System üóÉÔ∏è

**Automatic Protection**: Every save operation creates timestamped backups in:
```
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\TVGS\Schedule 1\Saves\nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\MixerThreholdMod_backup\
```

**Backup Structure**:
- Keeps 5 most recent backups per save slot (max 25 total)
- Format: `SaveGame_2_backup_2025-01-15_14-30-22`
- Automatic cleanup prevents disk space issues

**Restore Process**:
1. Navigate to backup folder above
2. Copy desired backup to main save directory
3. Rename to original save folder name (e.g., `SaveGame_2`)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Always backup current save first!**

## Technical Details ‚öôÔ∏è

### Thread Safety & .NET 4.8.1 Compatibility
- **No main thread blocking** - all file I/O uses async patterns or proper timeout protection
- **Thread-safe collections** - concurrent access handled safely across all operations  
- **Framework compatibility** - explicit .NET 4.8.1 syntax (no string interpolation, proper cancellation tokens)
- **Comprehensive error handling** - extensive try/catch blocks with verbose logging

### Performance & Reliability
- **Memory leak prevention** - proper resource disposal and cleanup
- **Atomic operations** - temp file strategy prevents partial writes
- **Emergency fallbacks** - multiple strategies for event attachment and save operations
- **Minimal game impact** - non-blocking coroutines maintain smooth gameplay

## Compatibility & Requirements üîß

- **Game**: Schedule 1 (latest version)
- **Framework**: MelonLoader + HarmonyLib
- **Target**: .NET Framework 4.8.1
- **Conflicts**: Compatible with most mods (extensive defensive programming)

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical MelonLoader Window Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**DO NOT CLICK** in the MelonLoader console window to inspect logs while the game is running:

- **Clicking pauses MelonLoader** and can cause the game to crash after a brief delay
- **To resume**: Press `Space` or `Enter` key, but damage may already be done
- **Safe inspection**: Use `Alt + Tab` to switch between windows - do not click inside the MelonLoader window
- **Log review**: Review logs after closing the game to avoid interruption

### üîÑ **IL2CPP Build Considerations**

**IL2CPP builds may show initial warnings** during mod initialization:

- **TypeLoadException messages**: These are expected during dynamic type resolution - the mod handles them gracefully
- **Longer initialization time**: IL2CPP builds require additional type loading time (5-10 seconds)
- **Manual console commands**: May take a moment longer to process due to dynamic type resolution
- **Performance**: Minimal impact during normal gameplay after initialization

**‚úÖ Both MONO and IL2CPP builds are fully supported** - initialization warnings in IL2CPP are normal and expected.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### Common Issues

#### Console Commands Not Working
- **MONO builds**: Ensure you're typing commands correctly (case-sensitive)
- **IL2CPP builds**: Wait for complete mod initialization (look for "initialization COMPLETE" message)
- Try the `help` command to verify mod is loaded
- Check MelonLoader logs for initialization errors

#### IL2CPP Build Issues
- **TypeLoadException messages**: Normal during initialization - mod handles these automatically
- **Slow initialization**: IL2CPP builds need 5-10 seconds for type resolution
- **Console commands delayed**: First few commands may take longer to process
- **Manual logging**: Use `msg` and `warn` commands to verify console integration is working

#### Save System Issues  
- Use `mixer_path` to verify save location
- Check available disk space in save directory
- Review logs for file permission errors

#### Performance Issues
- Use `profile` command to identify bottlenecks
- Monitor system resources with stress testing commands
- Consider reducing stress testing parameters

## Issue Reporting & Support üêõ

**When reporting issues, please provide as much detail as possible to help with troubleshooting:**

### Required Information
1. **MelonLoader Console Log** - copy the entire console output from when the issue occurs
2. **Save Game Details** - mention if issue happens on new saves, loaded saves, or specific save slots
3. **Reproduction Steps** - exact steps that cause the issue
4. **Game State** - how long was game running, were you saving repeatedly, any other mods active
5. **System Info** - Windows version, game version, MelonLoader version
6. **Error Messages** - any error dialogs, crashes, or unusual behavior

### How to Get Logs
- **MelonLoader Console**: Shows in-game when pressing F4 or check `MelonLoader/Latest.log`
- **Mod Logs**: Look for entries starting with `[MixerThreholdMod]`
- **Crash Logs**: Usually in game directory or MelonLoader folder

### Best Practices for Reporting
- **Be Specific**: "Save crashes" is less helpful than "Save crashes after 30+ minutes gameplay on SaveGame_3"
- **Include Context**: Were you using other mods, doing specific actions, or experiencing performance issues?
- **Test Isolation**: If possible, try reproducing with only this mod active

**The more information you provide, the faster we can identify and fix the issue!**
