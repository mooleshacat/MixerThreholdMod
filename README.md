# MixerThreholdMod üß™

A comprehensive mod for **Schedule 1** that enhances the mixer system with increased capacity, intelligent threshold control, and automatic save backup protection.

## About Schedule 1 üè≠

Schedule 1 is a business simulation game where you run a drug manufacturing operation. One of the core mechanics involves mixing products (cannabis, meth, cocaine, etc.) with additives using the in-game mixer system. The mixer has a threshold setting that controls how many items the chemist waits for before starting the mixing process.

## What This Mod Does üöÄ

### üîß Enhanced Mixer Capacity
- **Increases maximum mixer threshold from 10 to 20** - matching the game's maximum stack size
- **Persistent threshold settings** - your preferred settings won't reset when the game overwrites them
- **Smart threshold management** - prevents the game from forcing the threshold back to 1

### üíæ Automatic Save Backup System
- **Automatic backup of your last 5 saves** after each save operation
- **Crash protection** - if the mod (or any other mod) causes issues, your saves are safe
- **Timestamped backups** with easy-to-understand naming convention
- **Automatic cleanup** - old backups are removed to save disk space

### üõ°Ô∏è Stability & Safety Features
- **Comprehensive crash prevention** with extensive null checks and error handling
- **Memory leak protection** through proper resource disposal
- **Async operation safety** to prevent game freezing
- **Debug logging** for troubleshooting and monitoring

## Why This Mod is Essential üìà

**For Efficiency**: The default threshold of 10 forces you to wait longer for mixing operations. With items that stack to 20, you're losing potential efficiency. This mod lets you maximize your mixing operations.

**For Safety**: Extended gameplay sessions can lead to various stability issues. The automatic backup system ensures you never lose hours of progress due to crashes or corruption.

**For Control**: Take full control of your mixer settings without worrying about the game resetting your preferences.

## Installation üì•

1. Download the latest release from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1) (when available)
2. Extract the mod files to your Schedule 1 Mods directory
3. Launch the game - the mod will automatically initialize

## Backup System üóÉÔ∏è

### How It Works
After each save operation, the mod automatically:
1. Creates a timestamped copy of your save folder
2. Stores it in `MixerThresholdMod_backup` directory (next to your save folder)
3. Keeps the 5 most recent backups and removes older ones

### Backup Location
Your saves are stored every time you save game in:
```
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\TVGS\Schedule 1\Saves\nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\
```
Where each 'n' is a number. Structure is like so:
- nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\
  - SaveGame_1\
  - SaveGame_2\
  - SaveGame_3\
  - SaveGame_4\
  - SaveGame_5\
Your backups will be in:
```
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\TVGS\Schedule 1\Saves\nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\MixerThreholdMod_backup\
```
Structure is like so:
- MixerThreholdMod_backup
  - SaveGame_2_backup_2025-07-10_18-22-48
  - SaveGame_2_backup_2025-07-10_18-26-12
  - SaveGame_2_backup_2025-07-10_18-29-16
  - SaveGame_2_backup_2025-07-10_18-36-51
  - SaveGame_2_backup_2025-07-10_18-50-19

There will be 5 backups for each savegame (5x5=25 max saves)

### Restoring from Backup üîÑ

If you need to restore a backup:

1. **Locate your backup folder** (see location above)
2. **Find the backup you want to restore** - they're named with timestamps like:
   ```
   SaveGame_2_backup_2024-01-15_14-30-22
   ```
3. **Navigate to your main save directory** (usually `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\TVGS\Schedule 1\Saves\nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\`)
4. **Backup your current save** (copy SaveGame_2 somewhere safe)
5. **Delete or rename SaveGame_2 folder**
6. **Copy the backup folder** to the save location
7. **Rename it** to `SaveGame_2` (or whatever your original save folder was named)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always backup your current save before restoring, just in case!
