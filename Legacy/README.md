# Legacy Files

This folder contains legacy implementations and backup files from the data recovery process. These files are kept for reference but are not part of the active codebase.

## Contents

- **Duplicate implementations**: Old versions of files that now exist in the proper folder structure
- **Backup files**: Files ending in .old that were preserved during recovery
- **Alternative implementations**: Code that was merged into the current active implementation

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ **DO NOT** modify files in this folder
- ⚠️ These files are **NOT** included in the project build
- ⚠️ For active development, use the files in the main project structure

## Active File Locations

The current, active implementations are located in:
- `/Core/` - Core system components
- `/Helpers/` - Helper utilities and file operations  
- `/Save/` - Save management system
- `/Patches/` - Harmony patches
- `/Constants/` - Centralized constants
- `/Threading/` - Thread-safe collections
- `/Properties/` - Assembly information

## Cleanup Status

✅ Project structure cleaned and organized
✅ Merge conflicts resolved
✅ Constants refactored and expanded
✅ Duplicate files removed from root directory
