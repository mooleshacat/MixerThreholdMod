Welcome to your personal data input folder!

In here I will paste up to 3 types of files.

- No longer will you delete anything in this directory, human will manually confirm changes
and remove files no longer necessary.

- DO NOT reference these files contents in the code base (except comments)

=================================================================================================================

Please note the filename prefixes and possibility for multiple files.

- dnSpy related code (filename prefix: "dnSpy")
- filname is only a date/timestamp: logging from mod (filename has no prefix, look for date/timestamp as filename, shows melon logger logs if enabled, shows in mod log)
- compileErrors: list of compile errors from last test. (filename prefix: compileErrors)

Not all files will exist all the time. If you need logs, ask for recent logs. If you need any other dnSpy code, ask human, and inform what patterns to look for.

=================================================================================================================

Keeping the contents of dnSpyFromHuman_IMPORTANT.txt and folder Assembly-CSharp.dll\ project (dnSpy data) in mind, please process users last comments and complete the task / instructions that were assigned to you.
