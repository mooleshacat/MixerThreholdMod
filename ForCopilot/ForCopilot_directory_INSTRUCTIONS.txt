Welcome to your personal data input folder!

In here I will paste up to 3 types of files.

DO NOT delete this file, or the folder, we need to reuse it.

No longer will you delete anything in this directory, human will manually confirm changes
and remove files no longer necessary.

=================================================================================================================

Please note the filename prefixes and possibility for multiple files.

- dnSpy related code (filename prefix: "dnSpy")
- filname is only a date/timestamp: logging from mod (filename has no prefix, look for date/timestamp as filename, shows melon logger logs if enabled, shows in mod log)
- compileErrors: list of compile errors from last test. (filename prefix: compileErrors)

Not all files will exist all the time. If you need logs, ask for recent logs. If you need any other dnSpy code, ask human, and inform what patterns to look for.

=================================================================================================================

Keeping the contents of file in mind, and users last comments please complete the task / instructions that were assigned to you.
